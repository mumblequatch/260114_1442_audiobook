<p class="scene-heading first">EXT. UNDERWORLD, WHARF - NIGHT</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin had been walking, now, for what seemed like forever. They were out there, somewhere. They had to be.  Because every dead soul he talked to seemed to have heard about the two living people passing through. Because, they said, it hadn’t happened in at least a thousand years. Nice going, mom and dad. But so far, all he’d heard was hearsay. Nobody actually knew anything. Neither where they had gone nor who had taken them there.</p>
<p class="dialogue">His journey took him to a dark, nameless port town blanketed under a chilly drizzle, where, presently, he was trying not to slip on the wet cobblestones of a  peculiar street. Lanterns burned in windows with flames that gave no warmth, and the dead moved past him without a glance, going about their business as though being dead were just another kind of living.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The medieval-looking houses on either side leaned against each other like tired old men. And he could have sworn he’d already passed these same houses just minutes before. It wouldn’t surprise him — confusion, tedium and circularity were everywhere in the Underworld, like whirlpools waiting to entrap any who relaxed their vigilance.</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin was already getting tired. Soon he would have to find food of some kind and a place to sleep. But what Benjamin really needed was help. A friend. Someone to care enough to try to send him in the right direction. Despite the eternity through which they swam, the dead seemed to have time for nobody but themselves.</p>
<p class="dialogue">And, just as he had the thought,  he came upon a break in the endless wall of buildings: a side-street, sloping gently downward. *The ocean*, he thought. The port. There might be sailors there. And sailors brought news. Benjamin turned on to the street and quickened his pace.</p>
<p class="dialogue">When Benjamin finally reached the port itself, the dark buildings seemed to part like curtains to reveal it: a luminous, grey-green sea stretching to the horizon, with strange shapes like pale submarines floating through its gelatinous depths.</p>
<p class="dialogue">That was when he heard the music.</p>
<p class="dialogue">A guitar, plucked slowly. And a voice — deep, rich, a baritone that seemed to come from somewhere underground. The melody was simple and sad, and Benjamin followed it to the end of the wharf, where a figure sat on a coil of rope, playing.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The figure wore a deep hood that hid everything but a great, faintly green nose and a pair of pale, oversized hands that moved across the strings with strange grace. A raven sat on a post nearby, watching Benjamin with one black eye.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The music stopped.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know why you’re here, living boy.</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(beat)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You’re looking for your parents.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin’s heart leapt.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you know where they are?</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">I know how to find out.</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">One of the pale hands gestured toward the spectral ocean, where a ship sat at anchor in the distant gloom — black sails, black hull, lanterns burning with greenish fire.</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">You see that vessel? The Naglfar. Her captain is Bartholomew Roberts, and he and his crew have an object that does not belong to them. A seeing stone.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">What’s a seeing stone?</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">An object that allows a skilled practitioner to see what is, no matter how near or far.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">So you could look into it and tell me where my parents are?</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Hooded Figure nodded.</p>
<p class="character">BENJAMIN</p>
<p class="dialogue">Did they steal it from you or what?</p>
<p class="character">HOODED FIGURE</p>
<p class="dialogue">Not from me. From a creature of the deep — a demon old as the world. But that is not your concern. Your concern is your parents. Bring me the stone.</p>
<p class="scene-heading">EXT. UNDERWORLD, PORT - CONTINUOUS</p>
<p class="character">NARRATOR</p>
<p class="dialogue">Benjamin found a boat — a small thing, barely more than a raft with oars — and rowed out across the spectral ocean. The water was warm and thick, more like oil than water, and it glowed beneath the surface with pale light. He tried not to think about what might be swimming down there.</p>
<p class="dialogue">The Naglfar grew larger as he approached. It was a great galleon, old and barnacled, its black sails hanging limp in the windless air. As Benjamin drew alongside, he saw that the hull was studded with what looked like fingernails — thousands of them, yellowed and curling, pressed into the wood like scales.</p>
<p class="dialogue">He climbed the anchor chain and pulled himself over the rail.</p>
